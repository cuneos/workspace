This repository contains source code that help building high-quality and scalable software.

## Motivation

My name is Stefan Karlsson and I am a software engineer with a passion for building high-quality and scalable software. I started my career as a CSharp developer, in recent years I have worked more with NodeJS, hosted on various cloud services. My NodeJS and TypeScript skills are still limited, which is why I chose to start this project, to learn while building something that can be reused by others.
